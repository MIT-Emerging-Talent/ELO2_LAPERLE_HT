We are a team of dedicated and aspiring haitian data scientists
committed to using digital tools for positive change in our
country.This project count as our capstone project for our
graduation in Data and Computer Science program lead by
MIT-Emerging Talent program.

## Overview of the project

Through this project, we seek to transform Haiti's global
image, highlight its cultural,natural beauty
and promote sustainable tourism by using
modern digital technologies, data analysis and
community-driven insights all that on a website.

## Why tourism

Tourism is one of the most promising sectors for Caribbean countries,
attracting an increasing number of visitors every year. However, it
remains underdeveloped in several destinations across the region.
According to the WTTC, the tourism sector contributed more than 91
million dollars to the region’s GDP in 2024 and is expected to grow
by 7.4% in 2025. In addition, a study conducted by the World Tourism
Organization in partnership with Oxford Economics shows that the
sector supports nearly 3 million jobs—representing 15.7% of total
employment in the Caribbean for 2024.

## problem statement

We grew up with the image that Haiti cannot fully manage its economic
expenditures. Food insecurity and unemployment are increasing day by
day. Yet, the tourism sector remains neglected, and the country's
image is constantly tarnished online and internationally. As a
result, tourism stagnates in Haiti, despite strong growth in the
Caribbean. Three(3) of the five(5) most visited countries(Dominican
Republic,Jamaica, Cuba) in the region are just a few kilometers away
from Haiti. The Dominican Republic, which shares the same island with
Haiti, ranks first among these destinations. Both countries have
similar natural assets. The only difference lies in how crises
(political, natural disasters) are managed and the importance given
to the tourism sector.

In this context, the question arises: do crisis (political, natural
disasters, and the COVID-19 pandemic) have a significant impact on
tourist arrivals in Haiti?

## research question

'How can data-driven digital platforms showcasing Haiti’s natural
beauty, culture, and historical heritage change the global perception
of Haiti and promote sustainable tourism?'

## Findinds

Our correlation analyses show that political crisis and natural
disaster have not significant linear impact on tourist arrivals in
Haiti. This indicates that the country’s tourism potential remains
relatively stable, even during times of crisis.
At the same time, our predictive model for 2026–2027 indicates a
general upward trend in tourist arrivals in the Caribbean region,
suggesting a growing tourism market and potential demand that Haiti
can tap into.

Since crisis do not significantly affect tourism, digital platforms
have a stable foundation to showcase Haiti’s assets.The projected
growth in Caribbean tourism represents an opportunity to seize.
Well-targeted digital initiatives can capture this demand, attract
more visitors, and enhance the country’s international image.
By leveraging data-driven content on Haiti’s cultural, natural, and
historical heritage, digital platforms can not only strengthen global
perceptions of the country but also encourage more responsible and
sustainable tourism practices.

The results confirm that Haiti has exploitable tourism
potential and that digital platforms can play a key role in
transforming global perception and promoting sustainable tourism,
relying on a stable foundation and a growing regional market.

## Non-technical explanation of the domain

In this project, we plan to create a data-driven website to promote
sustainable tourism in Haiti. Beforehand, we are conducting a study
on regional tourism trends and examining how political crisis and
natural disasters affect the tourism sector in Haiti. Many
neighboring  countries, such as the Dominican Republic and Jamaica,
rely heavily on large-scale tourism promotion, and this strategy has
proven successful, as both countries are among the five(5) most
visited destinations in 2024.

We are using data on inbound tourist in Haiti and across the
Caribbean(1995-2022). Additionally, we are collecting information on Haiti’s
tourism assets, including beaches, tourist sites, cultural
attractions, safe areas, hotels, and more.

Our analysis focuses on the relationship between years of crisis in
Haiti and tourist arrivals, as well as regional tourism
trends,whether tourism is increasing or decreasing, and what Haiti
can potentially expect. The data on Haiti’s tourism assets will be
used to showcase content on the website.

## Limitation

* The data do not allow us to capture seasonality and do not enable
  us to identify peak periods within each year.

## Summary of our analysis approach

* We conducted statistical and machine learning analysis to evaluate
how do years of crisis correlate with tourist arrival in Haiti.

* We conduct a linear correlation to see if there is significant
  linear correlation between political crisis, natural disaster and
  tourists arrival in Haiti

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize trends in the tourist
sector both in Haiti and in the caribbean region
