# Retrospectives

## Stop Doing

. doing all the work locally before pushing on Github.
what mistakes did you make? did you miss a step? could your communication
have been better? be specific!

## Continue Doing

.Well communicated about tasks division and time-zone differences. I realize
that good communication can improve productivity and efficiency.

. Make sure all the members of the group are on the same page about
the project we are working on. That can save a lot of time and avoid
 many mistakes

## Start Doing

. Pushing each part that already completed on Github. Not waiting for the
all milestone to be complete locally before pushing on Github.
. Prepare what we will talk about or work on before each meeting.
Stop improvising during meeting
