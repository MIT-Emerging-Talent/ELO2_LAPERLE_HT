Haiti Paradise: WhatsApp Campaign Strategy Document
Introduction: Sharing the Heart of Haiti
Welcome to our heartfelt strategy for refocusing the world on Haiti's natural beauty – the hidden gems that make our island a true Caribbean paradise. This isn't about flashy ads; it's about genuine connections through WhatsApp, where conversations feel like chatting with family. We'll use a powerful combo of quizzes, surveys, and polls to engage potential visitors and the diaspora, collecting insights on what excites them, their memories, and who they'd share it with. These tools keep things fun and interactive, building a community that celebrates Haiti's soul. From there, we'll guide them to WhatsApp Channels for ongoing stories and eventually a simple website for planning their dream trip. Let's honor our beloved country by letting its beauty shine through every message.

The Combo Approach: Quizzes, Surveys, and Polls in Harmony
Why a combo? Because variety keeps folks coming back – a quick poll for instant fun, a quiz for playful discovery, and a survey for deeper sharing. Together, they collect gold: data on excitement spots, past visits, inspiring visuals, and referrals. Send these via WhatsApp broadcasts, timed for evenings when dreams of travel brew. Always add a human touch: "Hey, from one Haiti lover to another..." Incentives like "Share your story for a shoutout!" make it feel personal.

1. Quizzes: Gamify the Adventure
Quizzes turn curiosity into excitement, like a treasure hunt through Haiti's wonders. They're quick, scored for fun, and perfect for revealing preferences while educating subtly. Use them to cover inspiration and referrals – folks love sharing scores with friends!
