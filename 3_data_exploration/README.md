## Haiti Tourism: A Realistic Path Forward

This project is built around one clear and hopeful idea:

**Haiti can bring back millions of tourists and billions in revenue**
 **while political and security challenges continue.**  
Other Caribbean countries prove it every single day.

### What the data show

- From 2010 to 2018, Haiti went from under 400,000 to **over 1.25 million**
  **visitors per year**(+300 %), despite the country still recovering
  from the 2010 earthquake.
- The secret? Two simple things that worked perfectly:
  - The Haitian diaspora coming home to visit family
  - The private, fully secured cruise enclave of **Labadee**
   (almost 1 million passengers some years)
- Then instability and the 2020 pandemic collapsed the numbers again
- the proof is there: **when tourists feel safe, they come in huge numbers**.

### Success stories next door (they didn’t wait for perfect peace)

**Dominican Republic** - Poverty and crime in many zones **10+ million visitors**

**Jamaica** - Well-known gang violence in Kingston & elsewhere **4+ million**
**visitors & growing**

Their recipe is simple and proven:  
**Build and fiercely protect specific tourism zones**
(all-inclusive resorts, private beaches, secure historic districts,
fenced cruise ports). Tourists stay inside the “safe bubble” and never need
 to see the challenges outside

**Haiti is not just Port-au-Prince.**  
Most of Haiti is naturally beautiful, culturally rich, and ready to welcome
millions of tourists – we just need to protect and promote the right zones,
exactly like Jamaica and the Dominican Republic do every day.

They all use the same winning formula: **create safe tourism bubbles and let**
**the rest of the country solve its problems later.**

### Haiti Already Proved It Works (2010–2018)

From <400k to **1.27 million visitors** in just eight years.  
Key drivers: diaspora love + the 100 % secure Labadee cruise enclave
(1 million passengers some years).

### Haiti Is So Much More Than Port-au-Prince

The capital has problems, but the rest of the country is full of world-class
destinations that are calm, beautiful, and ready today:

- **The Nord and Cap-Haïtien area** offer the UNESCO-listed Citadelle Laferrière,
- miles of golden beaches, and the already-operating Labadee cruise port
- with direct international flights landing minutes away.  
- **Jacmel**, the Caribbean’s most charming bohemian town, is famous for
its colorful art scene, yearly carnival, and the magical Bassins-Bleu waterfalls,
 a short, securable drive from the capital.  
- **The entire South – Les Cayes, Port-Salut, and Île-à-Vache** – boasts some
of the most beautiful white-sand beaches in the entire region, crystal-clear water,
fresh lobster on the beach, and a laid-back vibe
that rivals anywhere in the Caribbean.  
- **Côte des Arcadins**, only an hour north of Port-au-Prince, already has a string
of beach resorts ready to reopen the moment safe access is guaranteed.
- **Lavallée and the Central Plateau** hide spectacular waterfalls, rivers
for rafting, cool mountain eco-lodges, and some of the best coffee in the hemisphere,
perfect for nature and adventure lovers.
These places already have everything tourists look for:  
beaches • history • culture • mountains • waterfalls • warm people • delicious food

They just need protected access and smart marketing.

### The Proven Model – Copy & Paste Success

1. **Secure tourism areas** (Cap-Haïtien → Labadee, Côte des Arcadins, Jacmel,
Les Cayes–Port-Salut)  
2. Dedicated police + private security (exactly like Jamaica’s Resilient Corridors)
3. Reopen and expand cruise ports (Labadee is ready, Cap-Haïtien
and a new southern port can open fast)  
All-inclusive and diaspora-focused packages (“Fly in, stay safe, enjoy paradise”)
Tell the true story: **Haiti’s beauty is alive outside the capital**

### Economic Power Waiting to Be Unlocked

- 2018 peak → ~US$700 million earned  
- Dominican Republic today → **$10+ billion** per year with social vulnerability,
random armed robberies, violent committed by motorcycle gangs.
- Jamaica → **$4+ billion** per year with open security challenges  

Every extra million tourists = tens of thousands of jobs in the Nord, Sud, Artibonite,
 and beyond.

### Final Message

Haiti is not Port-au-Prince.  
Haiti is Cap-Haïtien’s citadel at sunrise, Port-Salut’s white sand,
Jacmel’s carnival spirit, Labadee’s turquoise water, and the warmth of its people.

We have the beaches. We have the culture. We have the diaspora
ready to come home.
We already welcomed over a million visitors while rebuilding from an earthquake.

All we need are secure paths and the guts to shout it from the rooftops:
Haiti isn't broken-it's begging to be rediscovered.

**Haiti is open. Haiti is beautiful. Haiti is ready.**
