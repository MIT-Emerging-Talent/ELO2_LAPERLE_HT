# STRATEGY

Our strategy promotion considers multiple points. From knowing what
tourists are looking for to strengthening community. According to The
United Nations World Tourism Organization Sustainable Tourism defines
as “tourism that takes full account of its current and future
economic, social and environmental impacts, addressing the needs of
visitors, the industry, the environment and host communities”. These
are some points tourists can consider doing to make their travel
sustainable.

## Support Local Restaurants

While travelling in Haiti, spend some time in local restaurants and
food joints. Support these small businesses instead of having
multiple meals at the hotel you are staying in.
Supporting local restaurants means you will be sampling locally
sourced ingredients, which is an additional way of meeting new people
who are enthusiastic about you trying their traditional food.
That is also way to strengthen small communities and allow them to
exist for a long time.  

## Buy Souvenirs from Local Stores

When you visit Haiti, be sure to support their businesses by buying
some of the souvenirs. In doing so, you will promote authentic
artisans and their locally handcrafted items. You will also inject
money into the local economy, promoting the people’s work and
creating more local jobs

## Educating People

While visiting a small community, teach them something that can be
valuable for them in the future. Most of them didn’t go to school.
Youn can teach them new ways to protect their environment, skills
that can be monetize or new ways to improve what they are doing.

## Walk Where Possible

Walking is the most basic and convenient way of touring a new place,
in addition to reducing your carbon footprint. Get help from tour
guides who advise on areas that are safe to walk through and do so.
Additionally, some animals in the wild are rattled by heavy sounds
such as those produced by motor vehicles. Therefore, leave the van at
the entrance and just walk to avoid disturbing these animals.

## Share Your Sustainable Travel Experiences

This is also in line with spreading awareness of sustainable tourism.
Share your experiences with your family, friends and those on social
 media.

## Volunteering to Local Organizations Fighting

Take your time and give to non-governmental organizations and
community tourism projects that are fighting for sustainable,
responsible travel, animal rights and welfare, environment etc...
Research volunteering opportunities and organizers with whom your
time, money and resources will have positive impact.

## Don’t use plastics

Use plastics as little as possible or not at all. Say no to plastic
as a tourism sustainability measure.

## Take Care of Heritage Places

There are thousands of heritage sites worldwide which attract
millions of visits every year. Unfortunately, an estimated $6 billion
of the world’s cultural heritage is stolen and sold yearly. This,
therefore, calls for more people to take care of heritage sites.
Also, ensure that you don’t litter and take your trash with you,
do not graffiti, and don’t have your name emblazoned on the walls
or caves. And to the millennials, do not take a photo of yourself
sitting on these monuments, especially if a sign prohibits it.
These artifacts and monuments are fragile, maybe because of their
 old age and can be sensitive to the touch of hands, bags or shoes.
Take care of these sites so that they are open for more people.
to view in the future

## Respect the Practices of Local Peoples

Do not enforce your practices and beliefs on these locals.
When people are praying in churches or vodou temples or other holy
site be discrete.
